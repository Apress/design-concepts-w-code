Hi. 

The point we want to make here is that in order for the code to fit in the text we began a new line where appropriate for readability. All code has been tested several times. If it doesn't want to run, there is probably a new line holdover from Word. 

If we made an error, please send an email and we'll get back to you. kelly@praxis.ws or stanko@praxis.ws

Thanks, Kelly and Stanko
